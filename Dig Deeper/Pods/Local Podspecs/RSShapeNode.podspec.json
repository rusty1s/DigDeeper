  "description": "A RSShapeNode object draws a shape by rendering a Core Graphics path offscreen using a disconnected CAShapeLayer.  The CAShapeLayer is then snapshoted into an image and used as a texture of a SKSpriteNode, which is added as a child to the RSShapeNode. This technique fixes the insane amount of unfixable bugs and memory leaks of SKShapeNode.\n\nRSShapeNode has nearly the complete functionality of a SKShapeNode plus additional functionality that is missing in SKShapeNode, e.g. repeated textures, shadows, line dash patterns and fill rules.",
